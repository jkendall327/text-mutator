# Text Mutator

A tool that deliberately introduces minor errors into text to aid proofreading. By defamiliarizing your writing, it forces you to pay closer attention to each word and punctuation mark, helping you catch errors you might otherwise overlook.

## Why Use This?

When we read our own writing, our brains often auto-correct mistakes because we know what we intended to write. By introducing controlled mutations (swapped letters, removed punctuation, homophone substitutions), this tool makes your text just unfamiliar enough that you must read it more carefully.
