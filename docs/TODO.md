- place the managed identity used to execute the bicep pipeline in its own resource group to avoid lifetime issues with it being recreated/deleted.
- setup a git hook to prevent pushes if tests/builds fail locally?
- begin writing up docs
- begin cleaning up the code?
- properly send over mutations from rust
- try highlighting the mutations in the frontend?
- vertical scrollbars look ugly if too much text in input column
- make input column match mutation column aesthetically
- background scrolling effect
- general aesthetics
- make the bicep pipeline truly idempotent (linked backend, roles, app service container refresh...)
