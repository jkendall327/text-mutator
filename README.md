# Text Mutator

A web app that deliberately introduces minor errors into text to aid proofreading.

## Why?

Every writer's had the experience of glossing over obvious typos in a text because they're too familiar with it; those pernicious errors that have a penchant for only becoming visible the moment you hit 'publish'.

This app warps your text in small ways that force you to read it carefully, with fresh eyes, on a word-by-word level. The intent is that this will let you see the text with fresh eyes and thus appreciate other small errors (not introduced by the app) which you can then fix.

## Features

- Swap adjacent letters
- Remove punctuation
- Replace words with homophones (your/you're, their/there/they're, etc.)
- Configurable mutation rate
- Configurable seed for determinism

## Implementation

This app is a learning project for me, broken into three areas:
- Frontend development with React.
- Backend API dev with Rust.
- Bicep for infrastructure-as-code deployment.

More details TBD.
